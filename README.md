# Deutsche Telekom NB-IoT Hackathon demo and examples
Examples for Deutsche Telekom NB-IoT Hackathon using Tuino1 by Gimasi  and multiple Seeed Groove Sensors.

## General information
The examples and demos have been developed to support the Deutsche Telekom Corporate NB-IoT Hackathon. All examples are tested with the Tuino1 by Gimasi, a slidely adjusted Arduino Mega which can be programmed with the Arduino IDE. For communication via NB-IoT, the DT Arduino library, a NB-IoT SIM card and a DT Cloud of Things account are required.
